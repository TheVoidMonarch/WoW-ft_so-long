quick answer
Creating a Zelda-like game using C and the minilibx library involves implementing core game mechanics such as
character movement, collision detection, tile-based map rendering, and basic enemy AI.The process requires
understanding of game loops, sprite handling, and event management, with the implementation of these concepts
serving as a foundation for more complex game development in the future.(Note: A complete step-by-step guide with
detailed code snippets would be extremely lengthy and beyond the scope of a brief explanation. This topic requires
extensive programming knowledge and would typically be covered in a full tutorial series or book.)
